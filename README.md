# SIMRacingApps - Assetto Corsa Plugin
This plugin integrates Assetto Corsa in [SIMRacingApps](https://simracingapps.com/).

Right now, it only provides basic integration to show some basic dashboard elements.
**This plugin is still work in progress, expect minor and major issues!**
I am happy to receive feedback through the github issue tracker, though.

## Setup
[Download](https://github.com/haja/SIMRacingAppsSIMPluginAssettoCorsa/releases/latest) the latest release and upload it to your SIMRacingApps instance.
The upload button is at the bottom of the main page of your SIMRacingApps instance.

then, edit the settings.txt found under ~\Documents\SIMRacingApps. set sim to AC (instead of iRacing)
```
sim = AC
```

restart your SIMRacingApps server and you should be good to go!
